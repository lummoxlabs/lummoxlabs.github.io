### About Lummox Labs

Lummox Labs was created in early 2015 to focus on building best-in-class mobile apps. Based in Toronto, Lummox is focused on making indie mobile games.

Michael Busheikin is Lummox's founder. He heads up development, prototyping, testing, coloured rectangular interface design, workplace health and safety, cloud computing initiatives, and office DJ'ing.

Michael has been working in mobile since (almost) before it was cool. With experience as an employee at BlackBerry (when it was RIM), several startups, LinkedIn, Netflix, with side projects at Button Mash Games, he has lived and worked all over the world building apps.
